            PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a general-purpose
            programming language originally designed for web development. It was
            originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference
            implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally
            stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive
            initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.

            <li>
              PHP code may be executed: with a command line interface (CLI),
              embedded into HTML code,
            </li>
            <li>
              or it can be used in combination with various web template
              systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks.

          <p>
            PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a
            module in a web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
            executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted
            and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including
            images, with the generated web page. PHP can be used for many
            programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone
            graphical applications and robotic drone control. The standard PHP
            interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released
            under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be
            deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and
            platform, free of charge. The PHP language evolved without a written
            formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original
            implementation acting as the de facto standard which other
            implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to
            create a formal PHP specification.

          <p>
            The following "Hello, World!" program is written in PHP code
            embedded in an HTML document:
          </p>
          <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br />
            &lt;title&gt;PHP "Hello, World!" program&lt;/title&gt;<br />
            &lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;'; ?></code
          >
          <p>
            However, as no requirement exists for PHP code to be embedded in
            HTML, the simplest version of Hello, World! may be written like
            this, with the closing tag omitted as preferred in files containing
            pure PHP code:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;?='Hello world';</code>
          <p>
            The PHP interpreter only executes PHP code within its delimiters.
            Anything outside its delimiters is not processed by PHP, although
            non-PHP text is still subject to control structures described in PHP
            code. The most common delimiters are:
            <span>&lt;?php</span> to open and: <span>?&gt;</span> to close PHP
            sections. The shortened form: <span>&lt;?</span> also exists. This
            short delimiter makes script files less portable, since support for
            them can be disabled in the local PHP configuration and it is
            therefore discouraged; there is no recommendation against the echo
            short tag <span>&lt;?=</span>. Prior to PHP 5.4.0, this short syntax
            for: <span>echo()</span> only works with the:
            <span>short_open_tag</span>
            configuration setting enabled, while for PHP 5.4.0 and later it is
            always available. The purpose of all these delimiters is to separate
            PHP code from non-PHP content, such as JavaScript code or HTML
            markup. The first form of delimiters:,
            <span>&lt;?php</span> and <span>?></span>, in XHTML and other XML
            documents, creates correctly formed XML processing instructions.
            This means that the resulting mixture of PHP code and other markup
            in the server-side file is itself well-formed XML. Variables are
            prefixed with a dollar symbol, and a type does not need to be
            specified in advance. PHP 5 introduced type hinting that allows
            functions to force their parameters to be objects of a specific
            class, arrays, interfaces or callback functions. However, before PHP
            7.0, type hints could not be used with scalar types such as integer
            or string. Unlike function and class names, variable names are case
            sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide the
            ability to interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP
            treats newlines as whitespace in the manner of a free-form language,
            and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of
            comment syntax: <span>/* */</span> marks block and inline comments;
            <span>//</span> or <span>#</span> are used for one-line comments.
            The <span>echo</span> statement is one of several facilities PHP
            provides to output text. In terms of keywords and language syntax,
            PHP is similar to the C style syntax. <span>if</span> conditions,
            <span>for</span> and <span>while</span>
            loops, and function returns are similar in syntax to languages such
            as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.

            Data types

          <p>
            PHP stores integers in a platform-dependent range, either a 64-bit
            or 32-bit or 128-bit signed integer equivalent to the C-language
            long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in
            certain situations; this behavior is different from other
            programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using
            decimal (positive and negative), octal, hexadecimal, and binary
            notations. Floating point numbers are also stored in a
            platform-specific range. They can be specified using floating point
            notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native
            Boolean type that is similar to the native Boolean types in Java and
            C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are
            interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++. The null
            data type represents a variable that has no value;
            <span>NULL</span> is the only allowed value for this data type.
            Variables of the "resource" type represent references to resources
            from external sources. These are typically created by functions from
            a particular extension, and can only be processed by functions from
            the same extension; examples include file, image, and database
            resources. Arrays can contain elements of any type that PHP can
            handle, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>resources,</li>
            <li>objects,</li>
            <li>and even other arrays.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Order is preserved in lists of values and in hashes with both keys
            and values, and the two can be intermingled. PHP also supports
            strings, which can be used with:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>single quotes,</li>
            <li>double quotes,</li>
            <li>nowdoc or heredoc syntax.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Standard PHP Library (SPL) attempts to solve standard problems
            and implements efficient data access interfaces and classes.

            Functions

          <p>
            PHP defines a large array of functions in the core language and many
            are also available in various extensions; these functions are well
            documented in the online PHP documentation. However, the built-in
            library has a wide variety of naming conventions and associated
            inconsistencies, as described under history above. Custom functions
            may be defined by the developer:
          </p>
          <code
            >function myAge(int $birthYear):string {
            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// calculate the age by subtracting
            the birth year from the current year. <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$yearsOld = date('Y') - $birthYear; <br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// return the age in a descriptive string.
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $yearsOld . ' year' . ($yearsOld != 1
            ? 's' : ''); <br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            echo 'I am currently ' . myAge(1995) . ' old.';</code
          >
          <p>
            In 2019, the output of the above sample program is 'I am currently
            24 years old.' In lieu of function pointers, functions in PHP can be
            referenced by a string containing their name. In this manner, normal
            PHP functions can be used, for example, as callbacks or within
            function tables. User-defined functions may be created at any time
            without being prototyped. Functions may be defined inside code
            blocks, permitting a run-time decision as to whether or not a
            function should be defined. There is a
            <span>function_exists</span> function that determines whether a
            function with a given name has already been defined. Function calls
            must use parentheses, with the exception of zero-argument class
            constructor functions called with the PHP operator <span>new</span>,
            in which case parentheses are optional. Until PHP 5.3, support for
            anonymous functions and closures did not exist in PHP. While
            <span>create_function()</span> exists since PHP 4.0.1, it is merely
            a thin wrapper around <span>eval()</span> that allows normal PHP
            functions to be created during program execution. PHP 5.3 added
            syntax to define an anonymous function or "closure" which can
            capture variables from the surrounding scope:
          </p>
          <code
            >function getAdder($x) { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return function($y) use ($x) { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $x + $y;
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}; <br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            $adder = getAdder(8); <br />
            echo $adder(2); // prints "10"</code
          >
          <p>
            In the example above, <span>getAdder()</span> function creates a
            closure using passed argument <span>$x</span> (the keyword
            <span>use</span> imports a variable from the lexical context), which
            takes an additional argument <span>$y</span>, and returns the
            created closure to the caller. Such a function is a first-class
            object, meaning that it can be stored in a variable, passed as a
            parameter to other functions, etc. Unusually for a dynamically typed
            language, PHP supports type declarations on function parameters,
            which are enforced at runtime. This has been supported for classes
            and interfaces since PHP 5.0, for arrays since PHP 5.1, for
            "callables" since PHP 5.4, and scalar (integer, float, string and
            boolean) types since PHP 7.0. PHP 7.0 also has type declarations for
            function return types, expressed by placing the type name after the
            list of parameters, preceded by a colon. For example, the
            <span>getAdder</span>
            function from the earlier example could be annotated with types like
            so in PHP 7:
          </p>
          <code
            >function getAdder(int $x):Closure { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return function(int $y) use ($x):int {
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $x + $y;
            <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}; <br />
            } <br />
            <br />
            $adder = getAdder(8); <br />
            echo $adder(2); // prints "10" <br />
            echo $adder(null); // throws an exception because an incorrect type
            was passed <br />
            $adder = getAdder([]); // would also throw an exception</code
          >
          <p>
            By default, scalar type declarations follow weak typing principles.
            So, for example, if a parameter's type is <span>int</span>, PHP
            would allow not only integers, but also:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>convertible numeric strings,</li>
            <li>floats,</li>
            <li>booleans</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            to be passed to that function, and would convert them. However, PHP
            7 has a "strict typing" mode which, when used, disallows such
            conversions for function calls and returns within a file.

            PHP Objects
          </header>
          <p>
            Basic object-oriented programming functionality was added in PHP 3
            and improved in PHP 4. This allowed for PHP to gain further
            abstraction, making creative tasks easier for programmers using the
            language. Object handling was completely rewritten for PHP 5,
            expanding the feature set and enhancing performance. In previous
            versions of PHP, objects were handled like value types. The drawback
            of this method was that code had to make heavy use of PHP's
            "reference" variables if it wanted to modify an object it was passed
            rather than creating a copy of it. In the new approach, objects are
            referenced by handle, and not by value. PHP 5 introduced private and
            protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes,
            final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also
            introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors,
            similar to that of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and
            a standard exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added
            interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented.
            There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the
            runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with
            array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate
            can be used with the <span>foreach</span> language construct. There
            is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are
            bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time. If the
            developer creates a copy of an object using the reserved word
            <span>clone</span>, the Zend engine will check whether a
            <span>__clone()</span> method has been defined. If not, it will call
            a default <span>__clone()</span> which will copy the object's
            properties. If a <span>__clone()</span> method is defined, then it
            will be responsible for setting the necessary properties in the
            created object. For convenience, the engine will supply a function
            that imports the properties of the source object, so the programmer
            can start with a by-value replica of the source object and only
            override properties that need to be changed. The following is a
            basic example of object-oriented programming in PHP:
          </p>
          <code
            >1 &lt;?php <br />
            2 abstract class User { <br />

            4 <br />
            5 &nbsp;public function __construct(string $name) { <br />
            6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$this->name = $name; <br />
            7 &nbsp;} <br />
            8 <br />
            9 &nbsp;public function greet():string { <br />
            10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "Hello, my name is " .
            $this->name; <br />
            11 } <br />
            12 <br />
            13 &nbsp;abstract public function job():string; <br />

            The visibility of PHP properties and methods is defined using the
            keywords:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>public</span>,</li>
            <li><span>private</span>,</li>
            <li><span>protected</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The default is public, if only var is used; <span>var</span> is a
            synonym for <span>public</span>. Items declared
            <span>public</span> can be accessed everywhere.
            <span>protected</span> limits access to inherited classes (and to
            the class that defines the item). <span>private</span> limits
            visibility only to the class that defines the item. Objects of the
            same type have access to each other's private and protected members
            even though they are not the same instance.
